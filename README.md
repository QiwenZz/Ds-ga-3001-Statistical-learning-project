# Ds-ga-3001-Statistical-learning-project

To Do
- Re write the train_model_se for clarity
- Add majority voting for the ensemble (so far done averaging)
- Fix snapshot ensembling for Adam (same error on both my implementation and https://ensemble-pytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- Perhaps add more sophisticated augmentations (segmentations, mixup/cutmix, random augmentation, auto augmentation)
- Hyperparameter tuning(Vision transformer - Qiwen)

- Apply bayesian optimization package for hyperparameter tuning.
